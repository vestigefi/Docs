# Complete a Swap

To complete a swap, you must first complete the [Connect Your Wallet Step](../connect-your-wallet.md). Once you have connected your wallet, you are ready to complete a swap, view your transactions, etc. Before completing a swap, please review our guides for [Enable or Disable Swap Routes](modify-swap-routes.md) and [Adjust Swap Slippage](adjust-swap-slippage.md).&#x20;

### Step 1

Once your Wallet is Connected, find the **Algorand Standard Asset (ASA)** that you would like to swap with. For this example, we will use [VEST](https://vestige.fi/asset/700965019) &#x20;

### **Step 2**

**With the** [**VEST #700965019**](https://vestige.fi/asset/700965019) **ASA page open, you will see the Trade section.** &#x20;

### Step 3

**Enter the amount you would like to Swap. You can free type the amount, or select a percentage (25, 50, 75, 100%) based on your available amounts.**

**Note: The top value will always be how much you will pay and the bottom amount is the minimum amount you will receive once the swap is completed.** &#x20;

**On the swap screen, the user will show what type of swap will be completed (Single or Multi) and which Route(s) will be utilized to complete the swap. In the example below, we are completing a Single Route swap using Humble.**

**Based on the amount you are swapping, the aggregator will automatically (based on your slippage and enabled route settings) display a multi route swap. In the example below, the user can complete a swap using 3 routes at the same time in one transaction group.**

### **Step 4**

**Select the** Buy VEST **button which will initiate the transaction. For this step, you will need to use your wallet to accept the transaction and complete the request.**

### Step 5&#x20;

**Once the swap has completed, the user will see a Swap Successful note at the bottom of the trade section.** &#x20;
